## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience building high-performance web applications. I specialize in both backend and frontend development, working with Python and JavaScript frameworks like Django, FastAPI, React, and Node.js. I design scalable, reliable solutions using cloud platforms such as AWS, and have a strong background in API development, database management, and performance optimization for both web and mobile platforms. Clean, maintainable code and a focus on product quality are central to my approach.

I also bring hands-on experience in AI and machine learning. I’ve developed and integrated intelligent solutions - including chatbots, recommendation engines, and automation tools - using models like OpenAI’s GPT, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers. My skill set includes fine-tuning models, deploying them in production environments, and embedding AI-driven insights directly into applications.
